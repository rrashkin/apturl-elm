After cloning JeffHoogland/apturl-elm, I verified that, as is, it runs in Python2.x.  After changing “firefx” to “chromium-browser” in aptplay.py that ran.  apturl-elm aborts at sys.argv[1]. After ylee consult, “python apturl-elm apt:hexchat” works fine.

>>>at this point I think I need a consult before proceeding. Good news is it still runs!!

meanwhile, I’ll go on.
rashkin@rrLaptop:~/BLPython/apturl-elm$ ~/.local/bin/yapf --style google ./apturl-elm apturl-elm.new
no apturl-elm.new was created so I guess there are no errors. Anyway there were none reported.
Then, after many mostly “line too long errors”:
rashkin@rrLaptop:~/BLPython/apturl-elm$ ~/.local/bin/flake8 apturl-elm
rashkin@rrLaptop:~/BLPython/apturl-elm$
Still runs!!
